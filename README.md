# npm-multiple-entry-points

### Why entry-points?

These are entrypoints for specific components to be used carefully by the consumers. If you're using one of these entrypoints we are assuming you know what you are doing. So it means that code-splitting and tree-shaking should be done on the consumer/product side.

By definition it will use CJS as the main distribution entrypoint used in the app. However, this can be changed in the consumer's bundle step. This is the built-in scenario if the consumer uses toolings such as `Webpack`, `Rollup`, or `Parcel`.


## Setup and installation

Make sure that you are using the NodeJS version is the same as `.nvmrc` file version. If you don't have this version please use a version manager such as `nvm` or `n` to manage your local nodejs versions.

> Please make sure that you are using NodeJS version 6.10.2

Assuming that you are using `nvm`, please run the commands inside this folder:

```bash
$ nvm install $(cat .nvmrc); # install required nodejs version
$ nvm use $(cat .nvmrc); # use nodejs version
```

In Windows, please install NodeJS using one of these options:

Via `NVM Windows` package: Dowload via [this link](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows). After that, run the commands:

```bash
$ nvm install $(cat .nvmrc); # install required nodejs version
$ nvm use $(cat .nvmrc); # use nodejs version
```

Via Chocolatey:

```bash
$ choco install nodejs.install -version 6.10.2
```

### Install yarn

Navigate to your local repository and run

```bash
$ npm install
```

### Run the build

```bash
$ npm run build # run the tests
```

### Run the bundlesize check

```bash
$ npm run bundlesize # run the tests
```

### Run the code lint

```bash
$ npm run lint # run the tests
```

## Publish

this project is using `np` package to publish, which makes things straightforward. EX: `np <patch|minor|major>`
